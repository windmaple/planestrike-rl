Using policy gradient reinforcement learning to play Play Strike

This is a very straightforward adaptation of http://efavdb.com/battleship/. There are 3 versions, one with Tensorflow, one with Keras and one with Keras using convnet. Note that in the 2 files using Keras there are a bunch of code related to [Neocortex](https://scienceai.github.io/neocortex/) that you can ignore.

The Plane Strike game is very similar to Battleship except it's in a 6x6 board and have a plane-shape target. The game rule, result and some analysis are in the medium post.
